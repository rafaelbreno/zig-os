## About the Project

### Q&A
1. What's this repository based on?
    - > I bases this repository on Philipp Oppermann's posts ["Writing an OS in Rust"](https://os.phil-opp.com/), he wrote it using Rust, so, because I'm studying  Zig I thought about writing the same in Zig. :D 
2. Why?
    - > I want to learn.
3. Why zig?
    - > ... I want to learn ... zig
